# Foos and bars

In this file we introduce `foo` and `bar`,
two main concepts in the theory of xyzzyology.

## Main results

- `exists_foo`: the main existence theorem of `foo`s.
- `bar_of_foo_of_baz`: a construction of a `bar`, given a `foo` and a `baz`.
  If this doc-string is longer than one line, subsequent lines should be indented by two spaces
  (as required by markdown syntax).
- `bar_eq`    : the main classification theorem of `bar`s.

## Notation

 - `|_|` : The barrification operator, see `bar_of_foo`.
